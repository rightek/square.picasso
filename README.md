# Picasso
 Xamarin Android binding for [Square Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) (A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android)
 
This project is based on [this repo](https://github.com/mattleibow/square-bindings), I'm using `Picasso` in my projects, so I'll keep this repo up to date with [original (_java_) repo](https://github.com/square/picasso). _current version `2.71828`_
 
 ## Usage
For now there is no Nuget package available, so you can download the `dll` file from `dist` folder, or clone the repo and build the solution and use the generated `dll`.

## Dependencies
- [Xamarin binding for Okio](https://github.com/rightek/square.okio)
- [Xamarin binding for OkHttp](https://github.com/rightek/square.okhttp)
